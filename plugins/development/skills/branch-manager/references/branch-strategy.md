## Strategy Overview

### Core Principles

The branch management strategy is built on these foundational principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: AI-driven component work isolated from human-managed architecture
2. **Integration Safety**: Multiple validation layers before production deployment
3. **Clear Ownership**: Explicit branch naming indicates who/what is responsible
4. **Efficient Workflow**: Minimizes context switching and merge conflicts
5. **Traceability**: Clear history of what was developed and by whom/what

### Three-Tier Architecture

```
main (production)
└── develop (integration)
    └── feature branches (development)
```

Each tier serves a specific purpose:

- **main**: Stable, production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration testing and quality assurance
- **feature branches**: Active development work

## Branch Structure Rationale

### Why This Structure?

#### 1. Main Branch (Production)

**Purpose**: Represents production-ready, stable code

**Characteristics:**
- Protected branch (no direct commits)
- Only receives merges from develop
- Tagged with version numbers
- Deployable at any time

**Rationale:**
- Provides stable baseline for production deployments
- Enables quick rollbacks to known-good states
- Clear versioning for release management
- Prevents accidental production breaks

#### 2. Develop Branch (Integration)

**Purpose**: Integration and testing ground before production

**Characteristics:**
- Protected branch (no direct commits)
- Receives merges from feature branches
- Integration testing happens here
- Pre-production validation

**Rationale:**
- Catches integration issues before production
- Allows multiple features to be tested together
- Provides buffer between active development and production
- Enables continuous integration workflows

#### 3. Feature Branches (Development)

**Purpose**: Active development of specific features or fixes

**Format**: `<type>:<feature-name>/<work-type>-<component>`

**Characteristics:**
- Short-lived branches
- Focused on single feature or fix
- Merged to develop when complete
- Deleted after successful merge

**Rationale:**
- Isolates work in progress from stable code
- Enables parallel development
- Facilitates code review
- Easy to abandon if approach fails

### Naming Convention Design

#### Format: `type:feature-name/work-type-component`

**Example**: `feat:user-auth/leaf-login-form`

#### Component Breakdown

**1. Type Prefix (`feat:`, `bugfix:`, `hotfix:`, `refactor:`)**

**Purpose**: Categorizes the type of work

**Benefits:**
- Quick identification of branch purpose
- Automated CI/CD workflows based on type
- Clear in git history what kind of work was done
- Helps with release note generation

**Common Types:**
- `feat:` - New features (most common)
- `bugfix:` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix:` - Critical production fixes (fast-tracked)
- `refactor:` - Code improvements without behavior change

**2. Feature Name (`user-auth`, `dashboard`, `payment`)**

**Purpose**: Groups related work under common feature

**Benefits:**
- Multiple components can be tracked under same feature
- Easy to see all branches related to a feature
- Facilitates project management and planning
- Natural documentation of feature scope

**Conventions:**
- Lowercase with hyphens
- 2-4 words maximum
- Descriptive but concise
- Consistent terminology across team

**3. Work Type (`leaf-` or `core-`)**

**Purpose**: Distinguishes AI work from human architectural work

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- AI can focus on component implementation
- Humans focus on architecture and critical systems
- Reduces merge conflicts through clear boundaries

**4. Component Description (`login-form`, `api-endpoint`)**

**Purpose**: Specifies what component is being worked on

**Benefits:**
- Precise scope of work
- Easy to understand branch purpose
- Helps prevent duplicate work
- Clear for code review

## Leaf vs Core Philosophy

### The Distinction

The `leaf-` vs `core-` distinction is fundamental to AI-human collaboration:

#### Leaf Branches (AI-Driven)

**Characteristics:**
- Component-level work
- Implementation details
- UI components
- API endpoints
- Utility functions
- Data transformations

**Why "Leaf"?**
- Like leaves on a tree, they're numerous and replaceable
- Can be pruned or changed without affecting tree structure
- Individual leaves don't impact overall system architecture

**AI Advantages:**
- Fast implementation
- Consistent code style
- Good at following patterns
- Efficient at repetitive tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat:dashboard/leaf-chart-component
feat:dashboard/leaf-data-fetching
bugfix:header/leaf-responsive-layout
refactor:api/leaf-error-handling
```

#### Core Branches (Human-Managed)

**Characteristics:**
- Architectural decisions
- System design
- Critical infrastructure
- Security implementations
- Database schema design
- Authentication systems

**Why "Core"?**
- Like the trunk and branches of a tree, fundamental to structure
- Changes affect entire system
- Requires strategic thinking
- Needs human judgment and experience

**Human Advantages:**
- Strategic thinking
- Security awareness
- Performance optimization
- Long-term maintainability

**Examples:**
```
feat:user-auth/core-architecture
feat:payment/core-security
refactor:database/core-schema
```

### Decision Matrix: Leaf vs Core

Use this matrix to decide whether work should be leaf or core:

| Question | Leaf | Core |
|----------|------|------|
| Does it affect system architecture? | No | Yes |
| Does it require security considerations? | Minimal | Significant |
| Can it be easily replaced? | Yes | No |
| Is it component-specific? | Yes | No |
| Does it affect multiple systems? | No | Yes |
| Does it require strategic decisions? | No | Yes |
| Is it implementation detail? | Yes | No |

## Integration Strategy

### Why Multiple Integration Layers?

#### Layer 1: Feature Branch → Develop

**Purpose**: Component integration testing

**What's Validated:**
- Component works as intended
- Unit tests pass
- Code follows style guidelines
- No obvious bugs

**Process:**
```bash
# Merge feature to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feat:user-auth/leaf-login-form

# Run integration tests
npm test

# Verify functionality
npm run dev
```

#### Layer 2: Develop → Main

**Purpose**: Production readiness validation

**What's Validated:**
- All features work together
- Integration tests pass
- Performance acceptable
- No regressions
- Documentation updated

**Process:**
```bash
# After thorough testing in develop
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff develop

# Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Deploy to production
```

### Benefits of Multi-Layer Integration

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Catches issues before production
2. **Quality Gates**: Multiple opportunities for testing
3. **Rollback Safety**: Easy to revert at any layer
4. **Team Coordination**: Clear integration points
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Natural points for automated testing

## AI-Human Collaboration Model

### Collaborative Workflow

The branch strategy supports this ideal workflow:

#### Phase 1: Planning (Human-Led)

```
User: "Build user authentication feature"
├── Task Planner: Break down into components
│   ├── Login form (UI)
│   ├── Registration form (UI)
│   ├── Auth API endpoints
│   └── Auth system architecture
└── Branch Manager: Identify branch needs
    ├── feat:user-auth/leaf-login-form (AI)
    ├── feat:user-auth/leaf-registration-form (AI)
    ├── feat:user-auth/leaf-api-endpoints (AI)
    └── feat:user-auth/core-architecture (Human)
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation (Parallel Work)

**AI Work (Leaf Branches):**
```bash
# AI creates and works on component branches
git checkout -b feat:user-auth/leaf-login-form
# Implement login form component
git commit -m "feat: implement login form with validation"
```

**Human Work (Core Branch):**
```bash
# Human creates and works on architecture branch
git checkout -b feat:user-auth/core-architecture
# Design auth system, security, session management
git commit -m "feat: design authentication architecture"
```

#### Phase 3: Integration (Collaborative)

```bash
# Merge AI work first
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feat:user-auth/leaf-login-form
git merge --no-ff feat:user-auth/leaf-registration-form
git merge --no-ff feat:user-auth/leaf-api-endpoints

# Test AI components integration
npm test

# Merge human architecture work
git merge --no-ff feat:user-auth/core-architecture

# Final integration testing
npm test
npm run e2e
```

#### Phase 4: Cleanup (Automated)

```bash
# Branch Manager cleans up after successful merge
git branch -d feat:user-auth/leaf-login-form
git branch -d feat:user-auth/leaf-registration-form
git branch -d feat:user-auth/leaf-api-endpoints
git branch -d feat:user-auth/core-architecture

# Memory Bank documents completion
```

### Collaboration Benefits

1. **Clear Boundaries**: AI and humans know their roles
2. **Parallel Work**: No waiting for each other
3. **Reduced Conflicts**: Different files/components
4. **Quality Assurance**: Human oversight of critical code
5. **Efficiency**: AI handles repetitive tasks, humans focus on strategy

## Comparison with Other Strategies

### Git Flow

**Traditional Git Flow:**
```
main
├── develop
├── feature/*
├── release/*
└── hotfix/*
```

**Our Strategy:**
```
main
├── develop
└── <type>:<feature>/<work-type>-<component>
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Git Flow | Our Strategy |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Complexity | Higher (5 branch types) | Lower (3 branch types) |
| Release branches | Separate release/* | Handled in develop |
| Hotfixes | Separate hotfix/* | Tagged with hotfix: prefix |
| AI-Human distinction | Not addressed | Built-in with leaf/core |
| Feature grouping | Flat feature/* | Hierarchical type:feature/ |

**When to Use:**
- **Git Flow**: Large teams, complex release cycles, multiple production versions
- **Our Strategy**: AI-human collaboration, modern CI/CD, rapid development

### GitHub Flow

**GitHub Flow:**
```
main
└── feature/*
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | GitHub Flow | Our Strategy |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Simplicity | Very simple | Moderate complexity |
| Integration testing | In production | In develop branch |
| Branch types | Flat | Categorized with prefixes |
| Work distinction | Not addressed | leaf/core distinction |

**When to Use:**
- **GitHub Flow**: Small teams, simple projects, continuous deployment
- **Our Strategy**: Larger projects, need for integration testing, AI collaboration

### Trunk-Based Development

**Trunk-Based:**
```
main (trunk)
└── short-lived feature branches
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Trunk-Based | Our Strategy |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Branch lifespan | Very short (hours/days) | Short-medium (days/weeks) |
| Feature flags | Heavy reliance | Not required |
| Integration | Continuous to trunk | Via develop branch |
| Testing | Post-merge | Pre-merge in develop |

**When to Use:**
- **Trunk-Based**: High maturity teams, extensive automated testing, feature flags
- **Our Strategy**: Standard teams, developing new features, need for testing buffer

## Scaling Considerations

### Small Projects (1-3 developers)

**Simplified Strategy:**
```
main
└── feat:<feature>/leaf-<component>
```

**Modifications:**
- Can skip develop branch
- Merge directly to main after testing
- Still maintain leaf/core distinction
- Simpler naming convention acceptable

### Medium Projects (4-10 developers)

**Standard Strategy:**
```
main
└── develop
    └── <type>:<feature>/<work-type>-<component>
```

**Full implementation as described in this document**

### Large Projects (10+ developers)

**Enhanced Strategy:**
```
main
└── develop
    ├── integration/<feature-group>  (Optional integration branches)
    └── <type>:<feature>/<work-type>-<component>
```

**Additional Considerations:**
- Integration branches for related features
- More strict PR review processes
- Automated testing requirements
- Branch protection rules
- CODEOWNERS files

### Multi-Team Projects

**Team-Based Branches:**
```
main
└── develop
    ├── team-a/<type>:<feature>/<work-type>-<component>
    └── team-b/<type>:<feature>/<work-type>-<component>
```

**Additional Structure:**
- Team-specific develop branches (optional)
- Team-based code review
- Separate CI/CD pipelines per team
- Cross-team integration testing

## Workflow Automation Opportunities

### CI/CD Integration

Automate based on branch patterns:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'feat:**/leaf-*'   # Run tests on leaf branches
      - 'feat:**/core-*'   # Run additional security checks on core branches
      - 'develop'          # Full test suite
      - 'main'            # Deploy to production
```

### Branch Protection Rules

Protect critical branches:

```yaml
main:
  - Require PR review
  - Require status checks
  - Require up-to-date branches
  - No direct pushes

develop:
  - Require PR review (optional for small teams)
  - Require tests to pass
  - No direct pushes
```

### Automated Branch Cleanup

Clean up stale branches:

```bash
# Delete merged branches older than 30 days
git branch --merged | grep -v "\*\|main\|develop" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Delete remote branches not active in 60 days
git remote prune origin
```

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

Track these metrics to evaluate strategy effectiveness:

1. **Merge Conflict Rate**: Should decrease over time
2. **Time to Merge**: Should be reasonable (< 2 days)
3. **Branch Lifespan**: Should be short (< 1 week)
4. **Failed Merges**: Should be low (< 5%)
5. **Hotfix Frequency**: Should decrease (indicates stability)

### Continuous Improvement

Regularly review and adjust:

- Monthly retrospectives on branch strategy
- Gather feedback from developers
- Adjust naming conventions as needed
- Optimize for team size and project complexity
- Update automation based on pain points

## Conclusion

This branch strategy is designed to:
- Support AI-human collaborative development
- Provide clear structure without excessive complexity
- Enable efficient parallel work
- Maintain code quality through integration layers
- Scale from small to large projects

The strategy should be adapted to your specific project needs while maintaining the core principles of separation, integration safety, and clear ownership.
