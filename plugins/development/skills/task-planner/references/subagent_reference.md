## Parallel Execution Guidelines

### Tasks That Can Run in Parallel

**Independent UI and Backend Work**:
```
✅ Parallel:
- frontend-ui-developer: Create React component
- backend-api-developer: Create API endpoint
```

**Multiple Backend Features**:
```
✅ Parallel:
- backend-api-developer: Create user registration endpoint
- backend-api-developer: Create password reset endpoint
```

**Design and Development**:
```
✅ Parallel:
- ui-ux-designer: Design checkout flow
- backend-api-developer: Implement payment processing
```

### Tasks That Must Run Sequentially

**Dependent Work**:
```
❌ Cannot Parallel:
1. ui-ux-designer: Create wireframe
2. frontend-ui-developer: Implement wireframe (depends on #1)
```

**Build on Previous Work**:
```
❌ Cannot Parallel:
1. backend-api-developer: Create database schema
2. backend-api-developer: Write migration scripts (depends on #1)
```

**Testing After Implementation**:
```
❌ Cannot Parallel:
1. frontend-ui-developer: Implement feature
2. web-app-tester: Test feature (depends on #1)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Most Specific Agent
- Prefer specialized agents over general-purpose
- Example: Use `backend-api-developer` instead of `general-purpose` for API work

### 2. One Agent Per Task Type
- Don't mix agent responsibilities in a single subtask
- Example: Split "Design and implement user profile" into two tasks:
  - Task 1: ui-ux-designer for design
  - Task 2: frontend-ui-developer for implementation

### 3. Maximize Parallelism
- Always look for tasks that can run simultaneously
- Group independent tasks in the same batch
- Example: All Batch 1 tasks should have zero dependencies

### 4. Clear Task Descriptions
- Provide specific, actionable task descriptions
- Include enough context for the agent to work independently
- Example: "Create POST /api/users endpoint with validation" (good)
  vs. "Work on users" (bad)

### 5. Tool Mandates
- Always specify required tools for codebase operations
- Mandate serena tools for all code reading/writing
- Example: Explicitly list `mcp__serena-mcp__find_symbol` in task requirements

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Design → Implement → Test

```markdown
Batch 1:
- ui-ux-designer: Create wireframe

Batch 2 (after Batch 1):
- frontend-ui-developer: Implement based on wireframe

Batch 3 (after Batch 2):
- web-app-tester: Test implementation
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Frontend + Backend → Integration

```markdown
Batch 1 (parallel):
- frontend-ui-developer: Create UI component
- backend-api-developer: Create API endpoint

Batch 2 (after Batch 1):
- frontend-ui-developer: Connect UI to API
```

### Pattern 3: Multiple Independent Features → Documentation

```markdown
Batch 1 (parallel):
- backend-api-developer: Feature A
- backend-api-developer: Feature B
- frontend-ui-developer: Feature C

Batch 2 (after Batch 1):
- technical-documentation-writer: Document all features
```

### Pattern 4: Explore → Plan → Implement

```markdown
Batch 1:
- Explore: Understand codebase structure

Batch 2 (after Batch 1):
- Plan: Create detailed implementation plan

Batch 3 (after Batch 2):
- [appropriate-agent]: Implement based on plan
```
